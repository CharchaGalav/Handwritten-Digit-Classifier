This repository contains a simple handwritten digit recognition application using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented in TensorFlow/Keras. Users can draw digits on a Pygame window, and the application predicts the drawn digit using the trained model.

## Requirements
Python 3.9 <br>
TensorFlow <br>
Keras <br>
Pygame <br>
OpenCV <br>


## Results
The pre-trained model achieved an accuracy of 98.61% on the MNIST test dataset.
